        Here is a small collection of work across a range of mediums. As I've
        worked in a similar role at SCU for some time I'm hopeful that I've
        demonstrated enough ability in the skills you need in the role of
        Digital Producer and Designer so I thought it might be a nice idea to
        make you a website.
